# PCA and t-SNE Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to help you practice and understand two fundamental dimensionality reduction techniques used in machine learning: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**. The notebook provides hands-on implementation and visualization for both techniques.

## Overview

Dimensionality reduction is a critical preprocessing step in machine learning workflows, especially when working with high-dimensional datasets. It helps in:

- Reducing computational costs.
- Visualizing data in 2D or 3D.
- Removing noise and improving model performance.

This notebook focuses on two widely used methods:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A linear technique that projects data into a lower-dimensional space by maximizing variance.
2. **t-SNE:** A nonlinear technique aimed at preserving local structures in the data, making it ideal for visualizing clusters.

## Key Features

- Implementation of PCA and t-SNE using Python.
- Visualizations of high-dimensional datasets projected into 2D/3D spaces.
- Comparisons of the performance and use cases of PCA and t-SNE.
- Practical examples with annotated code for easy understanding.
